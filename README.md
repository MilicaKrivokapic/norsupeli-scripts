# **Norsupeli-scriptit** 🐘

This is a game about a confused little elephant who escaped from a circus and made a new life with other escapees. <br>
It is just a little prototype where I tried to learn how to make a game by myself.
<br>
Here is a picture of that game.

_Hello uncharitable fellows from the Circus, I'm going to shoot with a turnip_ -Norsu

You can now:

- Hurt the foul guys
- Eat bananas (gain health)
- Eat poison mushrooms(loose health)
- Run around in the map (movement)
- Go to your home (scene transition)
- Have a conversation with Mr. Bear (dialogue)

I probably will leave this project as it is, since I don't have a script nor the time for this. 😄
