# **Norsupeli-scriptit** 🐘

This is a game about a confused little elephant who ran away from a circus and made a new life with other escapees. <br>
It is just a little prototype where I tried to learn how to make a game by myself.
<br>
Here is a picture of that game.

I will probably leave this project as it is, since I don't have a script nor the time for this. 😄
